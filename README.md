This Repository contain the codes about MFC and ATMega128 for motor control


"그만터져128" is my team name that used while term project in the class [Robot Laboratory 4]
so you don't need to care what this name means. But if you can understand the Korean, definitely you smirk :)

Anyways, ATMega128 codes can be uploaded here, I uploaded MFC codes in google Drive because of its volume
Here's my Google Drive link to download the MFC codes about this project
